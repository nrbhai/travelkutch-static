The word 'Rogan' comes from Persian, meaning varnish or oil. This 300-year-old craft involves creating intricate designs using a thick, colored paste made from castor oil, applied with a metal rod without any brushes."},{"heading":"History","content":"Rogan painting originated in Persia and came to India around 300 years ago. The craft was brought to Kutch by Muslim artisans and has been preserved by the Khatri family through eight generations. By the 1980s, only one practitioner remained - Abdul Gafur Khatri. His dedication has revived this dying art, and today his sons continue this precious heritage."},{"heading":"Unique Technique","content":"Rogan Art uses a paint made by boiling castor oil for two days until it becomes a thick, sticky paste. Natural dyes are mixed into this paste to create vibrant colors. The artisan uses a metal rod to pick up tiny amounts of paint and creates designs by manipulating the paste with half the cloth. The cloth is then folded, transferring a mirror image to create perfectly symmetrical patterns - a technique called 'waraq'."},{"heading":"Abdul Gafur Khatri - Living Legend","content":"Abdul Gafur Khatri is the 8th generation Rogan artist and the man who single-handedly saved this craft from extinction. His work has been presented to international leaders including Barack Obama and Prince Charles.
